        "A volume shader evaluates how a GPU handles rendering data that occupies a three‑dimensional region rather than a simple surface. In practical terms, it stresses heavy math, iterative ray marching, and precision operations through dense fields. Because it computes lighting, distance estimates, and shading while traversing volumetric space, this test exposes performance ceilings that surface‑only scenes often hide.",
        "Unlike lightweight demos, a volume shader benchmark pushes hardware with cumulative steps per pixel and strict epsilon thresholds. This profile reveals how stable your frame time is when many samples accumulate along a ray. If a GPU struggles to sustain consistent throughput, the test will show stutter or thermal throttling faster than most traditional tests.",
        "Our volume shader BM test renders a Mandelbulb fractal through signed distance field ray marching. While not identical to every scientific or cinematic pipeline, it is intentionally compute‑intensive and reproducible, making it a credible proxy for complex volumetric scenes. The volume shader bm methodology ensures consistent results across different hardware configurations.",
        "When you perform the test, you're essentially stress-testing your GPU's ability to handle real-time 3D calculations that go far beyond simple polygon rendering. This volume shader bm provides insights into how your graphics card will perform when running advanced visual effects, games, or scientific visualization applications that rely heavily on shader computational power."

Flagship devices often handle medium quality settings well, while mid-range phones perform best with low quality presets.

          "q": "Why does the test lag on my device?",
          "a": "The test performs many math steps per pixel, which stresses ALU, caches, and thermal limits. Close extra tabs, lower screen brightness, and switch to Low or Medium mode. If throttling occurs, the system will slow until the device cools. This volume shader bm is designed to push hardware to its limits."

          "q": "How can I improve my volume shader bm score?",
          "a": "Keep the browser updated, enable hardware acceleration, and ensure the device is charged and cool. Lowering DPR or selecting a lower quality mode allows the test to maintain steadier frame time, which raises the volume shader bm score."

          "q": "What affects the benchmark score the most?",
