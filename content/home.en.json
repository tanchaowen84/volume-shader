        "A volume shader evaluates how a GPU handles rendering data that occupies a three‑dimensional region rather than a simple surface. In practical terms, a volume shader stresses heavy math, iterative ray marching, and precision operations through dense fields. Because a volume shader computes lighting, distance estimates, and shading while traversing volumetric space, it exposes performance ceilings that surface‑only scenes often hide.",
        "Unlike lightweight demos, a volume shader benchmark pushes hardware with cumulative steps per pixel and strict epsilon thresholds. This profile reveals how stable your frame time is when many samples accumulate along a ray. If a GPU struggles to sustain consistent throughput, the volume shader will show stutter or thermal throttling faster than most traditional tests.",
        "Our benchmark renders a Mandelbulb fractal through signed distance field ray marching. While not identical to every scientific or cinematic pipeline, this volume shader is intentionally compute‑intensive and reproducible, making it a credible proxy for complex volumetric scenes."

          "a": "A volume shader performs many math steps per pixel, which stresses ALU, caches, and thermal limits. Close extra tabs, lower screen brightness, and switch to Low or Medium mode. If throttling occurs, the volume shader will slow until the device cools."

          "q": "How can I improve my score?",
          "a": "Keep the browser updated, enable hardware acceleration, and ensure the device is charged and cool. Lowering DPR or selecting a lower quality mode allows the volume shader to maintain steadier frame time, which raises the score."

          "q": "Is my browser compatible?",
          "a": "Most modern browsers support WebGL 2.0. If the volume shader fails to start, check graphics settings, disable battery saver modes, and confirm hardware acceleration is enabled."

        {
          "q": "What affects the score the most?",
          "a": "Step count, epsilon thresholds, reflections, and DPR have large impacts. The volume shader is sensitive to thermal throttling, so long sessions may trend downward as temperatures rise."
        },
        {
          "q": "Does resolution change results?",
          "a": "Yes. Higher resolution multiplies the work per frame. The benchmark adapts DPR to keep the volume shader fair across devices, but a large viewport still increases total cost."
        },
        {
          "q": "Is this representative of production workloads?",
